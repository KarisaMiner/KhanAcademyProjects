--This project was completed as a part of Kahn Academy's SQL course.
I created two tables about famous people, which included data about the celebrity's name, age, career, marital status, and net worth. 
I then used a JOIN function to display information from both tables.--

CREATE TABLE famous_people 
(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
name TEXT,
age INTEGER,
career TEXT,
marital_status TEXT);

INSERT INTO
    famous_people (name, age, career, marital_status) VALUES ("Sam Smith", 30, "singer", "single");
INSERT INTO
    famous_people (name, age, career, marital_status) VALUES ("Ed Sheeran", 31, "singer", "married");
INSERT INTO
    famous_people (name, age, career, marital_status) VALUES ("Adele", 34, "singer", "divorced");
INSERT INTO

INSERT INTO

INSERT INTO

--What is the networth of each famous person listed in the famous people table?--
Select famous_people.name, networth.net_worth
From famous_people
Join networth
